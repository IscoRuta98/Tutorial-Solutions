## Aim

The university is about to hold elections for the new student body council. The university wants a system in place that voters can use to submit their votes and view results.

**Minimum requirement**: Your task is to build a blockchain based voting system using Algorand smart contracts and Python. Make sure the smart contract is deployed to the Algorand Test Network. Here are several guidelines to follow:

- Assume there are only five candidates
- Use PyTeal to build the smart contract.
- The smart contract should enable users to: 
    1) View Results in real-time. 
    2) Vote for one of the five candidates.
- The smart contract can only handle a maximum of n votes.
- Make sure that an Algorand address can only be used once to vote.

**Challenge**: Create a web based blockchain voting application. You can use tools covered in the tutorials, or any other tools you prefer.
